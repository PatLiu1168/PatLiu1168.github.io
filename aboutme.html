                                <b style="font-size:20px">Hi! My name is Patricia Liu.</b> <br>
                                I am a second-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for programming and autonomous technology. 
                                Some of my other hobbies include baking, fitness, and playing video games (in moderation of course). 
                                As an ISTJ, I have a relatively rational and honest outlook on life. 
                                However, my behavior cannot be limited by a personality test. 
                                I am open-minded and thrive in spontaneity. 
                                Currently, I am searching for opportunities to learn new skillsets and develop as an engineer. <br>
                                <br>
                                In the past, I've worked at Blackberry QNX as a member of the Core OS Test Team and the Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Centre (AVIC). 
                                With the Core OS Test Team, I was responsible for writing regression tests that verify the thread-safe and signal handler safe capabilities of libc API in the QNX RTOS. 
                                This experience was a fantastic opportunity to learn about multithreading, microkernel operating systems, and message passing. 
                                With AVIC, I was involved with the porting of ROS2 and AutowareAuto to QNX. 
                                I also worked on integrating the drive-by-wire system of a Lincoln MKZ to AutowareAuto and created a ROS2 interface for kvaser devices. 
                                Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of QNX, but I've also become more comfortable with cross-compiling, CMake, and the canbus. <br>
